/**
* This interface describes the required methods for a percolation system made up of a
* grid of n x n sites, all initially closed. These sites may be sequentially
* opened (but never closed). It considers that water flows from the top of the grid
* and detects:
* <ol type = "1">
* <li> Whether water flows to any given site from the top and </li>
* <li> Whether the system percolates. That is, water can flow from
* the top through open sites to the bottom of the system </li></ol>
*
*<p>Water can flow from one site to the next <b> only </b> if they share a border, so
* that water cannot pass directly between two squares joining only at the corner.
*
* <p>The entire system is said to percolate if a path of open sites (that is, where water
* can flow from one site to the next) exists from an open site on the top row to an
* open site on the bottom row.
*
* <p>An ideal implementation of this method will avoid the problem of "backwashing" or
* "backflow." Namely, when a system percolates, a site wich has no path to the top row
* does not fill with water even if it does have a path to the bottom row. Some (less
* ideal) implementations allow water to flow back through the bottom row after
* percolation and into sites which otherwise would not have contained water.
